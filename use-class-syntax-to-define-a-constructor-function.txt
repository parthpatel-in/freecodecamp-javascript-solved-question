/*

ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

In ES5, an object can be created by defining a constructor function and using the new keyword to instantiate the object.

In ES6, a class declaration has a constructor method that is invoked with the new keyword. If the constructor method is not explicitly defined, then it is implicitly defined with no arguments.
