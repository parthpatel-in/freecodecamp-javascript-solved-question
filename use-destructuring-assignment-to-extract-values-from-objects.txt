// Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

// Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line

const {today,tomorrow} =HIGH_TEMPERATURES
// Only change code above this line




/*Consider the following ES5 code:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;


Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { name, age } = user;*/
